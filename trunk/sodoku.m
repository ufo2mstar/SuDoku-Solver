function S = sodoku(M,S)
%[S,Mout] = sodoku(M,[S])
%
%A recursive program that solves 'sodoku' puzzles.
%
%Inputs:  M  partially filled 9x9 matrix with zeros in 'blank' cells
%         S  list of solutions (only used during recursive calls)
%
%Outputs: S  list of solutions
%
%Example:
%
% M = [0,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,8;6,0,0,0,8,5,0,3,0;0,0,7,0,6,0,1,0,0;...
%     0,3,4,0,9,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,5,0,4,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,1,0,4,2,0;...
%     0,0,5,0,7,0,9,0,0;0,1,0,8,4,0,0,0,7;7,0,0,0,0,9,2,0,0];

firstId = min(find(M(:)==0));

    [i,j] = ind2sub([9,9],firstId);

        ii = (ceil(i/3)-1)*3+1;
        jj = (ceil(j/3)-1)*3+1;
        mm = M(ii:ii+2,jj:jj+2); %these are the indices into the 3x3 block containing that cell
        if sum(M(i,:)==k)==0 & sum(M(:,j)==k)==0 & sum(mm(:)==k)==0  %OK for column, row, and 3x3 block
            M(i,j) = k;  %put this number in,
            S = sodoku(M,S); %and call this function recursively!
